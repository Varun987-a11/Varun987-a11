## 🚆 The Railfan's Code: My Unique Engineering Philosophy

I view software development much like managing a railway network: every component must be robust, and the entire system must run on an efficient, predictable schedule. This mindset guides my approach to every line of code:

* **Precision Engineering:** Every function must be as dependable as a railway switch, ensuring the 'train' (data/user) reaches its destination reliably.
* **Scalability:** Designing the 'tracks' to handle future traffic, meaning applications are built for growth and load.
* **Systemic View:** Understanding how changes in one part of the system (a backend database query) affect the entire network (frontend user experience).
