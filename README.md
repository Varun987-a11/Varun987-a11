## 🚆 The Railfan's Perspective (My Unique Edge)

My hobby, **Railfanning**, is more than just watching trains; it's a deep appreciation for **precision engineering, complex scheduling, and maintaining large-scale systems** under various conditions.

This perspective translates directly to my work:
* **System Reliability:** Ensuring the "tracks" (codebase) are always smooth and reliable.
* **Efficiency:** Optimizing every "journey" (user flow) for speed and resource conservation.
* **Attention to Detail:** Recognizing that the smallest component can ensure the success of the entire mechanism.
