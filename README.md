## 🚆 A Little About Me

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **railfanning**—capturing locomotives, tracking routes, or just enjoying that perfect horn echoing across the tracks. This passion for systemic precision and detail also fuels my coding. I document my hobby on my small YouTube channel, sharing the engineering beauty of rail transport.
